  <LongDescription>
## Clean Industry Zones
This pack introduces two new industrial zones that cause no air and ground pollution. A warehouse-only zone to store all kinds of goods and a 
clean manufacturing zone that processes only the following goods:
- (Convenience) Food
- Timber
- Paper
- Furniture
- Electronics
- Pharmaceuticals
- Beverages
- Textiles
    
The chance to spawn chimneys are greatly reduced, but sometime a chimney will still pop up. This is by design.
    
## Usage
Please note that these clean zones are supposed to be used in combination with default industrial zones. Some goods can't be produced in clean zones, so you need to use the default zones for those. 
The clean zones are suitable to be placed near residential areas, or in areas with an unfavorable wind direction.
